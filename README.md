  <h1>MARKET ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>International trade, economic transactions that are made
between countries. Among the items commonly traded are
consumer goods, such as television sets and clothing; capital
goods, such as machinery; and raw materials and food. Other
transactions involve services, such as travel services and payments
for foreign patents (see service industry). International trade
transactions are facilitated by international financial payments, in
which the private banking system and the central banks of the
trading nations play important roles. International trade and the
accompanying financial transactions are generally conducted
for the purpose of providing a nation with commodities it lacks
in exchange for those that it produces in abundance; such
transactions, functioning with other economic policies, tend to
improve a nation’s standard of living. Much of the modern history
of international relations concerns efforts to promote freer trade
between nations. This article provides a historical overview of the
structure of international trade and of the leading institutions that
were developed to promote such trade
  
The global trade management market size to grow from USD 0.9
billion in 2021 to USD 1.5 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual

gateway systems ,so we endorse the payment through emirates
corporation’s native token emirates via emirates pay payment

<h1>CURRENT PROBLEMS</h1>
<p>As globalization progresses, it has become easier for international
trading companies to enter new markets. While telecommunications
and transportation innovation has paved the way for globalization.
Many companies struggle with one fundamental aspect of their
business: exchanging money for goods and services. Below are six
issues that importers and exporters often face when dealing with
international payments.</p>

 <ul><li><h1>Hidden Fees</h1></li></ul>
<p>Trading companies pay much more than they need
to receive payments. Companies may incur a flat rate
for deposits. This is a fee in the range of $ 20 to $ 50
charged upon receipt of the transfer. In addition, the
intermediary bank may charge an additional transfer
fee in the middle of the transaction.<p>
  
 <ul><li><h1>Exchange Rates</h1></li></ul>
<p>The exchange rate affects both importers trying to pay for
goods and exporters trying to collect goods. Banks charge
a premium to the forex market, which is often well above
the intermediate market rate.<p>
  
 <ul><li><h1>Payment Tracking</h1></li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, international payments do not have carrier
tracking capabilities. The importer has no view of whether
or when their payment was received in the exporter’s
bank account. Besides, the exporter has no view of the
status of the payment.<p>
  
 <ul><li><h1>Importers Can’t Easily Pay</h1></li></ul>
<p>Importers are often restricted to paying by bank
transfer. They cannot use the latest payment methods
such as credit/debit cards and electronic wallets.<p>
  
 <ul><li><h1>Fraud</h1></li></ul>
<p>The more companies grow internationally, the more
compliance and money laundering prevention needs to
be considered.<p>
  
<h1>SOLUTION</h1>
<p>Simplifying Procedures Contract-related companies
had to pay for transactions through many complex
processes and a central financial institution, but
EMIRATESPAY simplifies the process of completing
all contractual procedures by negotiating and signing
contracts by transferring our payment gateway system
EMIRATESPAY through transferring our native token
EMIRATES or other cryptocurrencies</p>

<h1>SERVICE</h1>
<ul><li><h1> Credit and Debit card online payment
gateway</h1></li></ul>
<p>The main issue with the global adoption of cryptocurrencies is
the difficult-to-use user experience. 
  
EMIRATESPAY is developing a payment processing application
that allows cardholders to use cryptocurrencies as a payment
method while using the card like any other transaction
(encrypted card payment on the Internet). increase. We believe
that cryptocurrencies should be as easy to use and accessible as
FIAT. Our payment gateway allows all cardholders to purchase
products or services in cryptocurrencies to merchant wallets via
cards. Merchants also have the option to receive payments in
both cryptocurrencies and FIAT. </p>

<h1>PROJECT BUDGET</h1>
<ul><li><h1>15% Operations</h1></li></ul>
<p>To ensure that day-to-day operations continue running smoothly
as the organization expands, a greater focus will be placed upon
processes, and the hiring of additional operations managers will
be required.</p>

<ul><li><h1>15% Security</h1></li></ul>
<p>The foundation of what we build is the safety of our EMIRATES
CORPORATION customers. Start with the first of a series of
security audits. Each of the major new features introduced
requires additional review before considering deployment</p>

<ul><li><h1>10% Legal</h1></li></ul>
<p>10% compliance is key to EMIRATES CORPORATION’s long-term
success, and the attorney’s fee budget ensures compliance with
regulatory parameters in all new markets it enters.</p>

<ul><li><h1>10% Marketing</h1></li></ul>
<p>Given to eCommerce design, we anticipate our marketing budget
to be smaller than many technology companies. This will cover
ongoing community - building events and reaching the general
public via traditional marketing channels</p>

<ul><li><h1>50% Core Development</h1></li></ul>
<p>Core development includes both our Core Contributors and
Community - Driven development model fostered via EMIRATES
CORPORATION plat form. A large part of this budget will be used
to continue improving the end - user experience of the client
itself, implementing new features along with the creation of the
EMIRATESPAY Payment gateway development</p>

<h1>VISION</h1>
<p>The topic of financial access and financial inclusion is of
increasing interest around the world, especially in emerging and
developing countries. Policymakers are increasingly concerned
that financial intermediation and financial market interests are
not sufficiently widespread in all sectors of the population and
economy and can adversely affect growth, income distribution,
and poverty in particular. 
 
In addition, if the assets of the financial system are concentrated
in a relatively small number of individuals, companies, or sectors,
we may be concerned about the potential negative impact on
macro stability. It is important to distinguish between the use
and access to financial services.
  
Remember that Emirates Corporation has a vision that everyone
must have financial access. Emirates Corporation plans to
develop a smartphone app in the near future. By installing it
on your mobile phone, users can receive cryptocurrencies and
real currencies at the same time and convert them back to the
desired currency.</p>
